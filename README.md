# OpenCV-Project-1
python program using OpenCV Library, it detects and counts the apples passing on conveyor belt 

This repository contains a Python program that utilizes the OpenCV library to detect and count apples as they move along a conveyor belt. The program employs computer vision techniques to analyze real-time video input from a camera, identify the apples based on their distinct visual characteristics, and accurately count the number of apples passing by.

The application demonstrates the power of computer vision and image processing in automating the fruit sorting process. It can be used in agricultural or manufacturing settings where precise counting and sorting of objects, such as fruits or products, are required.

Key Features:

Real-time apple detection using OpenCV and image processing algorithms.
Robust object tracking on a moving conveyor belt.
Accurate apple counting and real-time display of the count.
Adjustable detection parameters for different lighting conditions or apple varieties.
Integration with a camera feed or video file for input.
